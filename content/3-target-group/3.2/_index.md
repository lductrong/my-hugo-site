In this task, we will create an Amazon S3 bucket to store all the audio files that will be generated by the application later. S3 is an ideal choice due to its security, scalability, and high durability (99.999999999%) along with high availability (99.99%).

## Steps to Follow:

**Step 1.** Navigate to the AWS Management Console and search for S3.

**Step 2.** On the S3 service page, select **Create bucket**.

**Bucket name:** Enter a unique name; here I named it **audioposts-19012003**.

Please note down the bucket name for future use.
{{% /notice %}}

**Object Ownership:** Select “ACLs enabled.”

**Block Public Access settings:**
- Uncheck “Block all public access.”
- Then uncheck all other options.

Select the box “I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.”

**Step 4.** Select **Create bucket** to complete the bucket creation.

Because each Amazon S3 bucket must have a globally unique name across all AWS accounts, if the name is already taken, AWS will display the error “Bucket with the same name already exists” and automatically take you back to the bucket name field to choose a different name. Try changing the numbers until the name is unique.

Conversely, you will receive a notification when the S3 bucket is created successfully.
