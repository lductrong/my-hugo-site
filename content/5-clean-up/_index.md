### Step 5
Wait for the stack deletion process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

Once the stack is deleted, all related resources will be removed from your account.

Thus, the resources have been cleaned up. To avoid unnecessary waste, it is advisable to regularly check for active services on your AWS account. For any services that are no longer in use, you should delete them.

This concludes the workshop. Thank you very much for participating!
